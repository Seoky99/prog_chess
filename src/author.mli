   Academic Integrity Statement

   course academic integrity policies.  I have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   enrolled in the course. If I did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom I collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:

   - none
