# Upgraded Chess 

This project is a two player spinoff of chess that employs mechanics that allow progression for the player and customizations for pieces and the board.    

Note to Henry and Alex:

--This is for setup
First obviously clone your local repository (git clone <link here>) 
Create your branch with git branch <name of branch> 
git push origin <name of branch> (this should make your branch show on the website) 
  
--This is for regular use 
git checkout <name of branch> 
git add . 
git commit -m "blah" 
git push origin <name of branch> 
(Then you go to github website and make a pull request) 
  
((To sync your branch with main:)) 
git checkout main 
git pull 
git checkout <name of branch> 
git merge main
